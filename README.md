# Polynomials-Fraction

This C++ program allows you to perform arithmetic operations on polynomials with fractional coefficients. You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and even modify the first polynomial using the results of addition operation (+=).

Check out [Polynomials-Integer](https://github.com/FarnoodID/Polynomials-Integer) for a similar program that operates on polynomials with integer coefficients.
