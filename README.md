# Polynomials-Fraction

This C++ program allows you to perform arithmetic operations on polynomials with fractional coefficients. You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and even modify the first polynomial using the results of addition operation (+=).

You can use this format for entering your polynomials. ``+(0/3)x^3-(6/1)x^4-(22/4)x^0``. Note that the order of the terms in the polynomials is not important. After each operation, the polynomial terms will be sorted in descending order of degree.

Check out [Polynomials-Integer](https://github.com/FarnoodID/Polynomials-Integer) for a similar program that operates on polynomials with integer coefficients.

To compile the C++ program, use the following command:
```bash
g++ Polynomials_Fraction.cpp -o output.exe
```
To run the program, use the command:
```bash
./output.exe
```

Alternatively, you can run the program online using [onlinegdb](https://onlinegdb.com/), a web-based compiler and debugger for C++ and other programming languages. Simply copy and paste your code into the editor, then click the "Run" button.
